## Carlos Martínez - Daahrien

As an accomplished game developer with years of experience, I have created a number of games throughout my career. While each project has taught me valuable lessons, I understand that some of my earlier games did not meet the high standards I hold for myself. For this reason, I have taken the decision to remove these games from my portfolio, and instead, focus on creating games that showcase my abilities and dedication to excellence.

Through the process of self-reflection and continuous improvement, I have learned to embrace my mistakes and use them as opportunities for growth. I understand that mistakes are an inherent part of any creative process, and I am dedicated to learning from each experience to improve my craft.

With a renewed focus on excellence and the valuable experience gained throughout my career, I am confident in my ability to create exceptional games that stand out in the industry. I am committed to delivering games that exceed expectations and provide players with a truly immersive and enjoyable experience.
